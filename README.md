# codealpha_tasks 
These tasks are part of my web development internship at Code alpha august 2023.


Task 1: create a multi page survey form
This code is designed to hide and show different steps of the form while updating the visual representation of completed and active steps in the form stepper.


Task 2: integrate captchA IN html form..
  instead of using captcha services from vendors liken google recaptcha... i had used captcha generator function..
  it checks if the the entered symbols are correct.

  it has advantages like :
  __no failure due to server
  ___no limit on total request
  ___no dependence on thirdparty
  ___robust and fast always

Task 3::clone the netflix
  this netflix clone is made using favicons and images from assests.
  It is similar to netflix and is made using html,css and js only

  thank you-----
